# Deep_Learning_Simpsons
This is a MATLAB code used to classify 5 main characters of Simpsons using deep learning
There are 5 classes in this project. Each class has 81 images and with this available images, 
a deep learning model has to be created to correctly identify the charachter in an image.

The model was build in MATLAB online and hence MATLABDRIVE was used to store the data.
